### How do we get access to Ruby from any location in command prompt?

To get access to ruby from any location in command prompt we should write a path of that file in .bash_aliaases file.

The .bashrc file also include .bash_aliases file. this file store the execution file path. it makes easy to read .bashrc file.

ex: i make 1 file named hello.rb
    now i want that this file can be run from anywhere in the computer.
    for that i set path variable in .bash_aliaases file (add below line in this file.)
      alias exefilename = "path/to/file/exefilename"
      ex: alias hello.rb="~/Documents/hello.rb"
